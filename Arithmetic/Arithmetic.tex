\section{Introduction}
Arithmetic is a branch of mathematics that deals with numbers and the basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

\section{Addition}
Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers to get a total sum. For example, \(2 + 3 = 5\).

\section{Subtraction}
Subtraction is the process of taking one number away from another. For example, \(5 - 3 = 2\).

\section{Multiplication}
Multiplication is the process of combining equal groups. For example, \(2 \times 3 = 6\).

\section{Division}
Division is the process of splitting a number into equal parts. For example, \(6 \div 3 = 2\).
